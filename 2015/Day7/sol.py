Themes: Bitwise operations, dependency tree when expanding nested logical/binary expressions

Commentary
This puzzle provides a great opportunity to show the power of
1. Recursion, and caching intermediate results
2. Structural pattern matching with Python's match-case syntax

If recursion must be avoided (e.g. to avoid hitting stack depth limits),
another way to incrementally populate a cache (dictionary) of known signals (wire values)
would be using a while loop to repeated iterate over the list of circuit instructions
and resolving/removing instructions which can be evaluated directly from literals and currently cached values.
